    <p class="p">The image on the left is a project I did for spanish. For the project I found a image on social media about bienestar (well-being). Then we wrote about the image, what it means, how it is helpful, and whether we agree or disagree with what the image is showing. It was meaningful to research and learn more about my well-being. </p>

  
    <p class="p">The image on the right is an art project I did. The goal was to draw a glass of water! For this project I needed a glass of water close by which I then drew. I learned a lot about diffrent ways to represent a glass of water, and I experimented a lot while drawing. </p>
