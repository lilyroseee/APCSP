    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <img class="image"  src = "flower3.jpg">
    <p class="p">I am in 10th grade at Piedmont High School. I love to ski and play soccer. I ski race at Palisades Tahoe, but the season has ended so I am not going up to Tahoe as much. As well, I love to explore and adventure around. I live with my parents and dog, Daisy in Piedmont. I also have a older sister who is currently in College, but she is coming home soon for summer. </p>
